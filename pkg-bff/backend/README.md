# nestjs-bff-backend

This is a companion package for [nestjs-bff](https://github.com/ahrnee/nestjs-bff). This package contains the infrastructure code for the backend api

## Overview

[NestJS-BFF](https://github.com/ahrnee/nestjs-bff) is a starter project for those looking to fast-track building a strongly typed, enterprise-grade, modern NodeJs application, with supporting tooling.

This implementation uses the [BFF](https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) pattern, leveraging [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) as the primary framework for the backend API. The client-side example is in [Angular](https://angular.io/), although any client-side Javascript framework can easily be used, including [React](https://reactjs.org/), or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) js.
